# 3D_GAN
Implementation of the paper "Shape Generation using Spatially Partitioned Point Clouds"

Paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06267#:~:text=We%20propose%20a%20method%20to,to%20spatially%20partition%20the%20points.) 

This is a pytorch implementation. The entire implementation is done in [this]() notebook

The code works best in Google Colab, just download the ShapeNet dataset to the appropriate folder and it will run smoothly.
